Euler Sim Todo:
//TODO Update and expand GUI in general
//TODO Add Show/Hide Button	showObstacle: false,		            
//TODO Make Changeable	scene.obstacleRadius = 0.15;	
//TODO Make changeable	scene.overRelaxation = 1.9;		
//TODO: Text changes work, but image source doesn't change
//TODO Sliding obstacle over source "blocks" it, moving obstacle into source does not.
//TODO Change all finite difference methods to central difference method
//TODO Maybe make difference methods modular
//TODO Decouple render speed from canvas size
//TODO Add method to control and compare different numerical methods
//TODO Let canvas size vary but sim size stays same, only visually stretched
//TODO Add 3D-Version with WebGl or p5.js
//TODO decouple simulation speed from rendering speed
//TODO Add dimensions to all physical units
//TODO Make number of cells independent of sim cell size
//TODO computeGradient can only handle one field at a tim => gradient of yVel and xVel calculated with different cells.
//TODO add static pressure
//TODO: Move solving of poisson-equation to its own function. Multiple iterations through all cells
//TODO  Make optional (430, 44) this.pressureField.fill(0.0); to show why its necessary. Clear pressureField.
//TODO Canvas stays small when you start in a small window. Influences fluid speed. window.innerWidth is browser specific/current window
//TODO Make (45, 45) gravity: -9.81, Changeable and part of FluidSimEuler
//TODO Make the timestep (46, 45) dt: 1.0 / 100.0, Changeable to show its effects on simulation collapse. 
//TODO Make overRelaxation Changeable and part of FluidSimEuler-Class	
//TODO Add different obstacles
//TODO Tie starting value to database: densitiy										
//TODO Tie starting value to database: viscosity                                    
//TODO Make part of simulator-class and changeable scene.gravity = -9.81; 
//TODO Make changeable, initial Velocity
//TODO Make changeable. Diameter of the pipe
//TODO Break down function draw() into smaler functions 
//TODO Make step-size changeable / controll streamline density
//TODO Separate FLIP-visualisation from simulator code
//TODO Unify Simulator Visualisation
